						<h3>Più e meno</h3>	
						<p>The visual game “Plus and minus” consists of 72 cards, each having a different image. Many of these images (48) have a transparent background and can thus be superimposed to compose other more complex images and stimulate the child’s creative capacities. Superimposing some of the tree images creates a wood. Superimposing on the wood the image of rain or that of the sun or moon, or of a flight of birds, or of a passing dog, and so on, the total image can be continuously modified.</p>

							<h3>I prelibri</h3>	
							<p>The PREBOOKS (a cult nowadays), published for the rst time by Bruno Danese in 1980, are a series of twelve small books ideally dedicated to very young children which have not yet learned how to read or write. These twelve little books (10 x 10 cm) are designed to t into small hands and come in many different and unusual colours, bindings and materials. They offer a variety of stimuli, sensations and emotions, raising from perceptions and images: “they should give the sensation that books are indeed objects made like this and that they contain a wide array of surprises. Culture comes out of surprises, which are things that were unknown before” (B. Munari).</p>

							<h3>Le forchette</h3>	
							<p>"This thing with forks is a game, a sort of mental exercise, the same as the one I play with children". Thanks to his intelligent and unexpected doodles, Bruno Munari knew how to discover the unusual in the mundane. And so a common object like the fork, through a simple exercise of the imagination, can become a hand. Actually, lots of hands.</p>

							<h3>Manifesto Campari</h3>	
							<p>The billboard designed by Bruno Munari for Campari is closely related to the opening of the M1 subway line in Milan, in November 1964: it is in fact a poster that considers a mobile, and at the same time fragmented, vision because, as the artist himself affirms, it does not lose “its strenght even if it is partially glimpsed, even if groups of people partially cover it, or if you look at it from the moving subway cars”.</p>

							<h3>Design as Art</h3>	
							<p>One of the last surviving members of the futurist generation, Bruno Munari's Design as Art is an illustrated journey into the artistic possibilities of modern design translated by Patrick Creagh published as part of the 'Penguin on Design' series in Penguin Modern Classics.
	
									'The designer of today re-establishes the long-lost contact between art and the public, between living people and art as a living thing'</p>

							<h3>Nella notte buia</h3>	
							<p>Published for the first time in 1956. Thanks to its intrinsic strength and the exceptional timelessness of the pictures, the book has now become a cult and a reference point in children's publishing. The different types of paper used, simplicity of the images and holes that echo the story lead the reader along the mysterious path of the "darkness of the night".</p>
